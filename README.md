# Learning Data Science

This is my repository for my iPython notebooks of exercises I work on for learning data science (python programming, applied statistics, and machine learning).

I want to have the notebooks also serve as documentation with notes so that I can go back and review topics and practical implementations.
My focus is on conceptual understanding of topics/techniques/methods and a hands-on implementation of the concept for a practical real life example.


If you use any of these materials, make sure to cite my work.
